Includes prettier and ESLint for code quality
Uses parcel for the development build

## To Use

- Clone or fork this project `git clone https://github.com/Whatapalaver/boilerplate_templates.git`
- Change into the directory `cd JS/React_Only`
- You may want to copy files to your own project folder
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- You should also create a .gitignore file to prevent all the node_modules files being sent to github: `echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore`
