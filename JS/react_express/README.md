To Use
----

- Clone or fork this project git clone https://github.com/Whatapalaver/boilerplate_templates.git
- Change into the directory `cd JS/react_express`
- You may want to copy files to your own project folder
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- You should also create a .gitignore file to prevent all the node_modules files being sent to github: echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore

Shout Outs

- Great tutorial by [Esau Silva](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-create-react-app-work-with-a-node-backend-api-7c5c48acb1b0) that I have used over and over to assist with the setting up a CRA linked to a backend express app that will actually host on Heroku.
- If you get bizarre effects on your heroku deployment which appears not to have updated, it may be time to [clear down the cache](https://help.heroku.com/18PI5RSY/how-do-i-clear-the-build-cache).
