Whatapalaver presents Boilerplate Templates!!
=====

I've created these for my own benefit really but feel free to steal or enhance as you see fit. 
The idea is to have some best practice apps with testing and linting environment setup.
Preferably should include some minimal additional code to show a "working" app.

JavaScript
----

- Minimal JS with Jasmine: ------> `cd JS/js_jasmine`
- Simple React App: -------> `cd JS/React_Only`
- Create React App with Express Backend and dummy API: -------> `cd JS/react_express`

Ruby
----

- Simple Ruby App with RSpec Testing: -------> `cd Ruby/ruby_rspec`
- Simple Ruby App with Sinatra, RSpec and Capybara Testing: -------> `cd Ruby/ruby_rspec_sinatra`

CSS / SASS
----

- A basic SCSS project framework with partials and import. Minimal illustrative css ------> `cd SASS`
