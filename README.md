Whatapalaver presents Boilerplate Templates!!
=====

I've created these for my own benefit really but feel free to steal or enhance as you see fit. 
The idea is to have some best practice apps with testing and linting environment setup.
Preferably should include some minimal additional code to show a "working" app.

JavaScript
----

- Simple React App: -------> `cd JS/React_Only`

Ruby
----

- Simple Ruby App with Jasmine Testing: -------> `cd Ruby/ruby_rspec`
