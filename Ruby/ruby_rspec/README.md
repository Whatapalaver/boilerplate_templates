Ruby Project Starter Template with RSpec Testing
====

This is a boilerplate template for a very simple Ruby project. It includes rspec, simplecov and a rubocop linter from Makers. [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) installed for debugging.

I've created a dummy 'starter-code' template so that all the test files can be linked up. Just change the names or delete and start from scratch.

To Use:
---

- Clone or fork this project `git clone https://github.com/Whatapalaver/boilerplate_templates.git`
- Change into the directory `cd Ruby/ruby_rspec`
- You may want to copy files to your own project folder
- Install dependencies `bundle install`

To test:

- This command will run both the rspec tests and simplecov `bundle exec rspec`
- To view the coverage detail as a webpage run `open coverage/index.html`
